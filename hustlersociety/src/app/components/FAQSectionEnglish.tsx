      question: "Who is this program actually for?",
      answer:
        "This is built for agency owners doing at least $10K/month who are ready to step out of day-to-day operations and scale with systems. Whether youâ€™re running a marketing, creative, or service-based agency, if youâ€™re still the bottleneck â€” this operating system was built for you. The best way to see if itâ€™s a fit is to book a quick strategy call and weâ€™ll walk you through how it applies to your model.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the program actually work?",
      answer:
        "We help you install the exact systems, processes, and leadership frameworks I used to scale multiple 7-figure companies. Itâ€™s not just training â€” itâ€™s implementation. We build the structure, workflows, and dashboards with you so you can immediately start running your business like a real CEO. On our call, weâ€™ll map out what that would look like for your agency specifically.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long until I start seeing results?",
      answer:
        "Most clients start seeing major clarity and regained time within the first 2â€“4 weeks. Revenue growth typically follows right after once systems start running without you. But this depends on your current setup, team size, and offer. On the call, weâ€™ll break down exactly what your timeline would look like and how fast we can roll out your operating system.",
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of results are people getting?",
      answer:
        "Clients whoâ€™ve implemented this system have scaled from $10K to $50K/month in their first month, doubled profit margins, and cut their workload by 10â€“20 hours a week. The goal isnâ€™t just more money â€” itâ€™s freedom and control. You can see their full results on the call, where weâ€™ll show you case studies and help you understand whatâ€™s possible for your agency.",
    },
    {
      question: "Whatâ€™s the investment to join?",
      answer:
        "It depends on the level of implementation support you need â€” whether you just want the framework or full hands-on setup with our team. We donâ€™t do one-size-fits-all pricing because every agency is at a different stage. Book a quick call and weâ€™ll break down the options transparently so you know exactly what makes sense for you.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a team already to make this work?",
      answer:
        "No. We help both solo founders and established agency teams. If youâ€™re solo, weâ€™ll help you prepare your systems so hiring becomes easy. If you already have a team, weâ€™ll plug in management and accountability systems so they perform without constant oversight. Either way, weâ€™ll show you how this works for your setup on the call.",
